        <p>Hello! I'm Christian Tino, a recent coding boot camp graduate with a passion for software development and a background in dental software systems. I'm on an exciting journey to transition into the dynamic world of tech.

My professional experience has equipped me with a diverse skill set ranging from CAD/CAM design to software support, honing my ability to adapt and thrive in fast-paced environments. As a CAD/CAM Nightguard Designer at Dandy, I leveraged advanced software tools like 3Shape Splint Studio and MeshMixer while spearheading the development of Standard Operating Procedures.

My educational pursuit at the University of North Carolina Charlotte's Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp has further enriched my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js. From crafting responsive client-side applications to co-engineering full-stack web applications using Agile methodologies, I've been immersed in collaborative projects that have enhanced my problem-solving abilities.

In my recent projects, such as "Dad vs Mom Jokes" and "Req, Res," I've demonstrated my proficiency in developing intuitive user interfaces and integrating third-party APIs to enhance functionality. Whether it's managing reservations or facilitating seamless software integrations, I thrive on tackling complex challenges and delivering innovative solutions.

Driven by a desire to continuously grow and learn, I'm actively seeking intern opportunities or entry-level positions where I can apply my newly acquired software development skills in a collaborative and dynamic environment. With a strong foundation in both dental software systems and web development, I'm excited to contribute to the innovative solutions shaping the future of technology.

Let's connect and explore how I can contribute to your team's success!</p>
